# Introduction to Visual Question Answering (VQA)

Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a multimodal AI task where a model must answer natural-language questions about an image.
It combines computer vision (for visual understanding) and NLP (for question comprehension and answer generation).

**Example:**
- Image: A man riding a bicycle.
- Question: What is the man doing?
- Answer: Riding a bicycle.

### Common Datasets
- **VQA v2:** Balanced dataset of everyday images and questions.
- **VizWiz:** Real-world photos taken by visually impaired users.
