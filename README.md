# Look, Ask, Explain: The VQA Challenge

## Welcome Onboard, Mentees! 🚀

Welcome to the **Visual Question Answering (VQA) & Image Captioning** project!

Over the next several weeks, we will dive deep into the exciting world where **Computer Vision** meets **Natural Language Processing**, and build an intelligent system that understands images and describes them in natural language.

By the end, you will design and train a complete **image captioning model** using a CNN/Vision Transformer encoder and an LSTM/Transformer decoder, along with explainability tools to visualize how your model thinks.

## ⚠️ A Small Note Before We Begin 
You're about to build a complete **vision-to-language model**, one of the coolest applications in AI.

But Before we begin, here’s something important I want you to remember:

This is an **advanced-level, fast-paced** project. We will be moving through concepts like
**CNNs → ViTs → LSTMs → Transformers → Attention → Explainability**
in a matter of weeks — so staying **consistent** will make a huge difference in your learning.

That said, don’t let the pace intimidate you. This journey is meant to challenge you, not overwhelm you.

And please — **never hesitate to reach out if something isn’t clear.**
If a concept feels confusing, if your model is misbehaving, or if you encounter an error that looks like it came straight from a horror movie… just ping us :)

You’re not expected to know everything. You are expected to stay curious, ask questions, and keep learning.

We’re in this together — and I’m here to guide you every step of the way.
**Let’s build something amazing together! 🚀**

## Project Overview
This project introduces you to Vision-Language AI, focusing mainly on Image Captioning while also connecting concepts to VQA systems. This repository will guide you through key concepts in CV and NLP and culminate in building a full image captioning pipeline..

You will:
* Understand core concepts in CV and NLP
* Learn how images and text can be mapped into a shared representation
* Build an encoder–decoder architecture for caption generation
* Train your model on real datasets
* Evaluate your generated captions using industry-standard metrics
* Use explainability tools like **Grad-CAM** and **attention heatmaps**

No advanced multimodal models (like BLIP or CLIP) will be used — this project focuses on classical yet foundational architectures that give you complete conceptual clarity and hands-on experience.

## 🗓️ Learning Roadmap (5 Weeks)

### 📍 Week 1 — Foundations of Computer Vision
We begin with CV fundamentals and essential tools you need for understanding and processing images.

#### Topics Covered
* Image processing basics (filters, edges, color spaces)
* Image embeddings & preprocessing
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Transfer learning for feature extraction
  
### 📍Week 2 — Foundations of NLP
This week focuses on the language side of our problem.
#### Topics Covered
* Tokenization & vocabulary building
* Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU)
* Attention basics
* Transformers (BERT, GPT-style architectures)

### 📍Week 3 — Bridging CV + NLP for Image Captioning and Explainibility 
we will explore some advanced architecture in the domain of Conputer Vision and  merge everything to build the foundation of your captioning model — and understand why it works.

#### Topics Covered
* Encoder–Decoder architecture
* CNN/ViT as the image encoder
* LSTM/Transformer as the caption decoder
* Attention mechanism for caption generation
* Explainability (XAI) in Image Captioning
  * Grad-CAM for CNNs
  * Attention heatmaps
  * Visualizing word-to-region alignment

### 📍 Weeks 4–5 — Final Project: End-to-End Image Captioner 🏆
Your main deliverable: a fully functional captioning model.

## 📝 Deliverables & Expectations
To ensure consistent progress and to maintain a professional development workflow, you are expected to:

### 📌 1. Maintain Your Own GitHub Repository
You must:
* Create a **personal GitHub repository** for this project
* Update it **every week** with notebooks, scripts, and visualizations
* Follow clean coding practices and maintain folder structure
* Include a final ```README.md``` explaining your final model and results
Your GitHub repo will serve as your project portfolio and is mandatory for course completion.

### 📌 2. Weekly Mini-Projects
Over the first three weeks, you will complete short weekly assignments:
* Week 1: CV-based tasks (feature extraction, transfer learning demo, etc.)
* Week 2: NLP-based tasks (tokenization, LSTM demo, text preprocessing)
* Week 3: Encoder–decoder integration + explainability (Grad-CAM, attention maps)
  
**To qualify for certification, you must:**
1. **complete at least 2 out of these 3 weekly projects along with the final project**
2. **Complete the final image captioning project (mandatory)**
3. **Submit all deliverables on time**

Failure to meet these requirements will make the mentee ineligible for the certificate.
